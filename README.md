# Mini Projects

This repository presents a curated collection of small-scale, focused projects developed as part of continuous learning and practical exploration in data science. Each project demonstrates the application of techniques and tools across various areas such as data collection, preprocessing, modeling, and visualization.

These projects are intended to highlight specific problem-solving approaches rather than complete end-to-end systems. They serve as evidence of practical understanding and hands-on experience with real-world data and commonly used Python libraries.
